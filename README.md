# Android Calculator App

This Android calculator app is a mini project developed as part of a Mobile Development class. The app is built using Java and Android Studio, and it provides users with both basic arithmetic calculations and advanced scientific functions.

## Features

- **Portrait and Landscape Layouts:** The app supports both portrait and landscape orientations, with separate layouts optimized for each mode.
- **Basic Calculator:** In portrait mode, users can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Calculator:** When the device is rotated to landscape mode, the app switches to a scientific calculator layout, offering advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.
- **mXparser Integration:** The app utilizes the mXparser library for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, ensuring accurate calculation results and support for complex mathematical operations.
- **Dynamic Activity Switching:** Activity switching is seamlessly handled based on the device's orientation, ensuring a smooth user experience during layout changes.
